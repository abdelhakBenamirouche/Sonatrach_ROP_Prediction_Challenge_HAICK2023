# Sonatrach ROP Prediction Challenge HAICK2023

This is my solution to the challenge proposed by <a href="https://sonatrach.com/">Sonatrach</a> during the haick 2023 datathon.
The goal was to **to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the Rate of Penetration (ROP) in drilling operations using real-world data from the Algerian energy company, Sonatrach**.
